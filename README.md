# Game-Project-1


[SpaceCakes](https://clausan121.github.io/Game-Project-1/) is a space-age, kitty-packed spin on a classic item catcher browser game.  Use the arrow keys to move the Space Cat left, right, up and down to catch the falling cupcakes, earning 1 point for each one caught, while avoiding the falling sugar shards. Player loses 1 life for every shard caught, and the game ends when all 3 lives are gone.  The object of the game is to score as many points as possible before losing all 3 lives.  



## Architecture and Technologies

The project was implemented with the following technologies:

* JavaScript and and jquery for overall structure, game logic, and DOM manipulation
* HTML5 Canvas for rendering
* Bootstrap


## Technical Implementation

1 day was dedicated to researching HTML5 Canvas.  


## Future Implementations

Additional features to add include:
* Creating diverse levels (increase/decrease amount of falling items)
* Variety of "power" items (i.e stars to increase life count, rainbows to consume all cupcakes)
* Allowing player to select difficulty level
* Integrating audio
